# Find The Smallest Number

I'm going to hand you the pile of index cards.  I want you to hand me a post-it note with the *smallest* number in the pile written on it.

You have your own stack of post-it notes and a pencil to help you keep track of things.

## The Rules

We're going to stop reminding you of the rules after this.

Remember:

1. You can only look at one index card at a time by flipping them over, one after another.

   No spreading out the cards and inspecting them visually all at once!
1. You can use as many post-it notes as you want, but each post-it note can only have one number written on it.

   This is so you don't use a single post-it note to do complex calculations by writing very, very small.
1. You can re-use a post-it note by erasing the existing number and writing a new number on it.
1. You can add numbers, compare numbers, decide when to flip the next card, when to write something on a sticky note, and when to hand back the sticky note containing the answer.

If you feel like these rules prevent you from getting started, just do what makes sense to you. The goal is to constrain the way you interact and recall information in a way that's similar to a computer.

## Describe the Process

Describe the process you carried out in English.  You should describe what to put on sticky notes and when, when to flip cards, what to do with the information you can see at each step, and when to return the sticky note with the answer.

You can use any terminology and symbols you want. You are free to give names to different pieces of information, e.g., the pile of index cards, the number you're currently looking at, the sticky note(s) you're writing on, etc.

## Looking at Code

After you've written down a description, look at [pseudocode.md](pseudocode.md) and put your description side-by-side.  What is similar? What is different? Does the pseucode describe the same process?

Next, open [syntax.md](syntax.md).

Once you've convinced yourself that the pseudocode does describe a process that solves the problem, look at [syntax.md][syntax.md].  This contains actual implementations in multiple languages.  Do you see how these programs represent the same procedure as your description and the pseudocode?

Put them side by side with the pseudocode and your description.  Take note of which pieces of syntax map to something you understand and which pieces don't.  Many of these pieces of syntax you can search for.
