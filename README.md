# Index Card Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises for absolute beginners that use only index cards and a pen or pencil — no syntax. Whether you're a beginner or a teacher, these exercises are a great way to get started.

By the end, you'll be familiar with the core concepts found in most programming languages as well as the core syntax. You'll be able to break down the steps necessary to solve simple problems — even if they're unfamiliar! — and translate those into code.

## What We Are Practicing

A composer has to know the raw material of music — melody, harmony, rhtyhm, etc. — but we wouldn't say that someone who sits down at a piano and starts plonking away at keys is "composing."  Likewise, a programmer has to know the syntax of a particular programming language, but producing code is only part of the work a programmer does.

Rather than starting with syntax, we want to get you thinking about problems you already know how to solve in the way a programmer would. We will then show you how that thought process translates into actual, runnable code in JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.

This will make the syntax feel more natural and easier to recall.

These exercises contain 80% of the the fundamental concepts you'll need to write any program you want. Almost everything you learn after this will be additional concepts, tools, and techniques to help you (the programmer) stay sane as the complexity of your programs grow.

No, really.

1. Model part of a system, problem, or process in our head
1. Translate that model into code a computer can execute
1. Refine our model as we get feedback from the computer
1. Repeat the above until our model is complete and our code does what we expect

## Index Card Exercises

To do these exercises you need only two things:

## Who These Exercises Are For

Even if you're familiar with the syntax of a particular language, you might get value out of these exercises.  Below are three snippets of code in JavaScript.

Each snippet contains reasonable code, but all the names have been replaced with nonsense.  The computer doesn't care that the names don't make sense to us humans, though. Can you read the poorly-named code and describe in a single sentence it does? Can you think of better names for all the parts of the code?

If the snippets look like gibberish or you spend more than a minute trying to understand any of them, then these exercises will be worth your effort.

### Snippet 1

What does this code do?  You should be able to answer with something like "`papaya` is a function that takes _____ as arguments and tells us ______." You should be able to think of better names immediately.

```javascript
function papaya(x, y) {
  for (let banana of x) {
    if (banana === y) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```

```javascript
function papaya(x, y) {
  for (let banana of x) {
    if (banana === y) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

```
